Creating an interactive Java Swing GUI for a hospital DBMS


Develop an application that interviews a patient for some general medical history data using a binary tree to drive the process, implemented using the Java language and using the Java Swing graphical user interface, and the MySQL database to store data. Think of the interview as a digital physician that asks the user questions regarding their medical history.
